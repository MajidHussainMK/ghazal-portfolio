# How to Extract Publications from Google Scholar

## Quick Method:

1. Open the Google Scholar profile: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t41u06IAAAAJ&hl=en

2. Open your browser's Developer Console:

   - **Chrome/Edge**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+J` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+J` (Mac)
   - **Firefox**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+K` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac)
   - **Safari**: Enable Developer menu first, then press `Cmd+Option+C`

3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `extract-publications.js` into the console

4. Press Enter

5. The script will:

   - Extract all publications from the page
   - Display them in the console
   - Copy the HTML code to your clipboard automatically

6. Paste the HTML code here and I'll update the website!

## Alternative: Manual Copy-Paste

If the script doesn't work, simply:

1. Go to the Google Scholar page
2. Copy the publication titles, authors, journals, and years
3. Paste them here in any format
4. I'll format and add them to the website
